there is other object detection mechanism like the YOLO 

Yolo uses a different approach this divide the images into 
regions and predicts the boudery boxes and then which is highlighted
is given out as result.

but here we are using keras bcs it is much easier to learn
and to use as it helps in making models just by adding layers
and then train it.
it is also maded and backed up by google so it is always geting 
better.
then it also allows use to load the model and deploy the model
in any platform.




here we are using open cv as it is the most popular
although it has some flaws but it was easier to learn as many resoures 
available for free so we went with that there are other like 
google vision api
microsoft computer vision 
but difficult to learn

it also has many prebuild algorith like 
we are using harr cascade xml.
